# Haptic

## Install

> This component requires you to install `@bumbag-native/haptic` as a separate dependency.

## Import

```js
import { Haptic } from "@bumbag-native/haptic";
```

## Usage

The `Haptic` component is a headless component that can be used to trigger haptic feedback. Underneath the hood, it clones the child element & attaches an `onPress` method to invoke the haptic feedback.

```jsx-live
<Haptic>
  <Button onPress={() => console.log('pressed button with haptic feedback!')}>
    Continue
  </Button>
</Haptic>
```
